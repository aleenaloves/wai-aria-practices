        <a href="../../#browser_and_AT_support">browser and assistive technology combinations</a>,
        especially for <a href="../../#mobile_and_touch_support">mobile/touch devices</a>.
        Testing code based on this example with assistive technologies is essential before considering use in production systems.

        The <a href="https://aria-at.w3.org">ARIA and Assistive Technologies Project</a>
        is developing measurements of assistive technology support for APG examples.
